      <strong>Meesappulimala</strong>
   <p>Meesappulimala
    Near to the famous hill station Munnar in Kerala is a lesser known destination called Meesappulimala
     - a destination for the highly adventurous. The second highest peak in the Western Ghats, here you can 
     have a memorable trekking experience with clouds in company. This mesmerizing paradise of nature is slowly
      getting popular among ardent trekkers.
    <br>
    Travel a distance of 24 km from Munnar via Mattupetty through Aruvikkad estate and you will reach the base camp
     of Meesappulimala. The journey to the base camp is difficult, yet exciting. En route you can see the Pandava
      cave. The villagers believe that the Pandavas, the heroes of the Indian epic Mahabharata, stayed in this 
      cave during their twelve years of exile in the forest. This beautiful cave also shelters countless small
       and chirpy birds.
    <br>
    The Kerala Forest Development Corporation (KFDC) will arrange all the facilities for trekking and camping. 
    You will be accompanied by an expert guide provided by the KFDC. 4 km from the base camp is the Rhodo Valley, 
    the last point accessible by any four wheelers. Tents are available at Rhodo Valley for those who want to enjoy
     a stay at this beautiful place. The walk way to the Rhodo Valley is bedecked with pine trees. The check dam 
     here provides crystal clear ice-cold water for the weary travellers. Nature is clad in her best attire here,
      which will ease the weariness of the physically demanding climb. The crisscrossing streams make the trip all
       the more interesting.
    <br>
    Keep your eyes and ears open, if you are lucky you will even get a chance to come across elephants, gaur and 
    Nilgiri tahrs, that too, in their natural habitat. If you start early in the morning, you will reach the top 
    of the peak by noon, where you will be at an altitude of 8,661 feet from the sea level. From the top you will
     get a panoramic view of Anamudi, the highest peak in the Western Ghats the Mattupetty and Anayirangal 
     reservoirs, and parts of Tamil Nadu. You can also relish the spectacular view of the surrounding waterfalls 
     including the gorgeous Kurinji waterfall. At this height you can even have a tête-à-tête with the drifting 
     clouds. Surely, Meesappulimala would be an experience that will linger on your mind forever.
