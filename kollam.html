    <h2>Kollam</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Kollam is an ancient seaport and the fourth largest city in the Indian state of Kerala. 
        Located on the southern tip of the Malabar Coast of the Arabian Sea, the city is on the banks 
        of Ashtamudi Lake and is 71 kilometers (44 mi) northwest of the state capital, Thiruvanathapuram 
        (Trivandrum).Kollam is one of India's oldest continuously inhabited cities,with evidence of
         habitation stretching back to the megalithic; the city has also been a maritime entrepôt millennia,
          the earliest attestation of which dates back to the Phoenicians and Romans.
           It is the southern gateway to the Backwaters of Kerala, and is known for its cashew processing,
            coir manufacturing, and tourism industries.
<br><br>
Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. 
The Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in 
trade at the port of Kollam for millennia.As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was mentioned by Ibn 
Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year 
travels.Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese 
settlement at Kollam. In the ninth century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir 
found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller,
 who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in
  his capacity as a Chinese mandarin. Kollam is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by 
  St Thomas as well as one of the 10 oldest mosques believed to be found by Malik Deenar in Kerala. Roman Catholic
   Diocese of Quilon is the first diocese in India.
<br><br>
V. Nagam Aiya in his Travancore State Manual records that in 822 AD two East Syriac bishops Mar Sabor and 
Mar Proth, settled in Quilon with their followers. Two years later the Malabar Era began (824 AD) and Quilon became 
the premier city of the Malabar region ahead of Travancore and Cochin. Kollam Port was founded by Mar Sabor at 
Tangasseri in 825 as an alternative to reopening the inland seaport of Kore-ke-ni Kollam near Backare (Thevalakara), 
which was also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils.
 Thambiran Vanakkam printed in 20 October 1578 at Kollam was the first book to be published in an Indian language.
<br><br>
Kollam city corporation received ISO 9001:2015 certification for municipal administration and services.
As per the survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on urban area growth during January 
2020, Kollam became the tenth fastest growing city in the world with a 31.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020.
It is a coastal city and on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam
 district and is a prominent trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is 
 second highest among the 500 most populous cities in India. Kollam is one of the least polluted cities in
  India.
<br><br>
During the later stages of the rule of the Chera monarchy in Kerala, Kollam emerged as the focal point of trade
 and politics. Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial centre in Kerala. Four major trading centers
  around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur, and Karunagapally. Kollam appeared as Palombe in Mandeville's 
  Travels, where he claimed it contained a Fountain of Youth.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>As the ancient city of Quilon, Kollam was a flourishing port during the Pandya dynasty (c. 3rd century BC–12th century), 
        and later became the capital of the independent Venad or the Kingdom of Quilon on its foundation in
         c. 825. Kollam was considered one of the four early entrepots in global sea trade during the 13th century,
          along with Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, the Chinese city of Quanzhou, and Malacca in the Malaysian
           archipelago.It seems that trade at Kollam seems to have flourished right into the Medieval period as in 1280,
            there is instance of envoys of Yuan China coming to Kollam for establishing relations between the local
             ruler and China.
<br>
       <h4>Pandya rule</h4> 
       <hr>
        The ancient political and cultural history of Kollam was almost entirely independent from that of the rest 
        of Kerala. The Chera dynasty governed the area of Malabar Coast between Alappuzha in the south to Kasaragod
         in the north. This included Palakkad Gap, Coimbatore, Salem, and Kolli Hills. The region around Coimbatore
          was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. first and the fourth centuries CE and it served 
          as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and Tamil
           Nadu.However the southern region of present-day Kerala state 
           (The coastal belt between Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha) was under Ay dynasty, who was more related to the
            Pandya dynasty of Madurai than Cheras.
        <br><br>
        Along with (Muziris and Tyndis), Quilon was an ancient seaport on the Malabar Coast of India from the early 
        centuries before the Christian era. Kollam served as a major port city for Pandya dynasty on the western coast
         while Kulasekharapatnam served Pandyas on the eastern coast. The city had a high commercial reputation from
          the days of the Phoenicians and Ancient Romans. Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD) mentions Greek ships anchored at
           Muziris and Nelcynda. There was also a land route over the Western Ghats. Spices, pearls, diamonds, and 
           silk were exported to Egypt and Rome from these ports. Pearls and diamonds came to the Chera Kingdom from 
           Ceylon and the southeastern coast of India, then known as the Pandyan Kingdom.
        <br><br>
        Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek Nestorian sailor,in his book the Christian Topography who visited the 
        Malabar Coast in 550, mentions an enclave of Christian believers in Male (Malabar Coast). He writes, 
        "In the island of Tabropane (Ceylon), there is a church of Christians, and clerics and faithful. Likewise
         at Male, where the pepper grows, and in the farming community of Kalliana (Kalliankal at Nillackal) there
          is also a bishop consecrated in Persia in accordance with the Nicea Sunnahadose of 325 AD.
          "The Nestorian Patriarch Jesujabus, who died in 660 AD, mentions Kollam in his letter to Simon, 
          Metropolitan of Persia.
        <br><br>
        Kollam is also home to one of the oldest mosques in Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of
         Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 AD at Kodungallur with the mandate of the
          last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who left from Dharmadom to Mecca and converted 
          to Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, 
          the Masjids at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini,
           and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest Masjids in Indian
            subcontinent.It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.</p>
